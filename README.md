# Lepton FLIR 3.5 based IR Tool Wear Monitor 

## Quick Description 
<p> As part of my doctoral dissertation [Citation pending] and subsequent research publication [Citation pending]. 
I built this app to monitor for tool wear of an endmill in real time during milling operations. 
The goal was to monitor the temperature of the endmill while cutting a sample part [Dissertation citation] and then develop a linear regression model to establish a relationship between tool wear and temperature.
The intended end goal is to develop a low-cost tool wear sensor that can be integrated in any system, but that is in the future.
I took heavy inspiration from Ramirez-Nunez *et al.* [3] but of course, took my own approach. </p> 

## Camera Showcase 
<p> The Lepton FLIR camera was chosen for this project since it is a low-cost, opensource IR camera with multiple modules available for usage. There are  </p>
